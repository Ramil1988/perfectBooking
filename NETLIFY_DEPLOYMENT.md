## 🎨 Customize Your Deployment

### Change Site Name

**Via Netlify Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Site settings**
2. Click **"Change site name"**
3. Enter your desired name: `perfectbooking` or `yourbusiness-booking`
4. Your URL becomes: `https://perfectbooking.netlify.app`

**Via Netlify CLI:**
```bash
netlify sites:update --name perfectbooking
```

### Add Custom Domain

**Step 1: Buy a domain** (from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)

**Step 2: Add to Netlify**
1. Go to **Domain settings** in Netlify
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain: `perfectbooking.com`
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

**Step 3: Netlify handles HTTPS automatically!**

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Already configured in `netlify.toml`, but you can override:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_STORAGE = true
   ```
3. Redeploy for changes to take effect

## 🔧 Configuration Files Included

Your repository already includes:

### `client/netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  command = "REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_STORAGE=true npm run build"
  publish = "build"
  base = "client"

[build.environment]
  REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_STORAGE = "true"
```

### `client/public/_redirects`
```
/*  /index.html  200
```

These ensure proper SPA routing and localStorage mode activation.

## 📱 After Deployment

### Test Your App

1. **Visit your Netlify URL**
2. **Login with test accounts:**
   - Admin: admin@business.com / admin123
   - Super Admin: superadmin@platform.com / superadmin123
3. **Create a booking** to test localStorage
4. **Close and reopen browser** - data should persist!

### Share Your Demo

Update your README.md with the actual URL:
```markdown
**Live Demo**: [https://your-site.netlify.app](https://your-site.netlify.app)
```

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub, Netlify auto-deploys when you push:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin main

# Netlify automatically:
# 1. Detects the push
# 2. Runs the build
# 3. Deploys new version
# 4. Your site updates in ~2 minutes! 🚀
```

### Deploy Previews

Every pull request gets its own preview URL:
- **Main branch**: `https://perfectbooking.netlify.app`
- **PR #1**: `https://deploy-preview-1--perfectbooking.netlify.app`

Perfect for testing before merging!

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Netlify Analytics (Optional - Paid)

Enable in Site settings to track:
- Page views
- Unique visitors
- Traffic sources
- Popular pages

### Or Use Free Alternatives

Add to your site:
- **Google Analytics**: Add tracking ID to `public/index.html`
- **Plausible**: Privacy-friendly analytics
- **Simple Analytics**: Minimalist tracking

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Error**: `Command failed with exit code 1`

**Solution**: Check build logs for specific error:
```bash
# Test build locally first
cd booking/client
REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_STORAGE=true npm run build
```

### Routes Don't Work (404 errors)

**Solution**: Ensure `_redirects` file exists in `public/` folder:
```bash
echo "/*  /index.html  200" > client/public/_redirects
```

### localStorage Not Working

**Check environment variable**:
1. Site settings → Environment variables
2. Verify: `REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_STORAGE = true`
3. Redeploy if needed

### Site Loads but Shows Blank Page

**Clear browser cache**:
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Or clear cache in settings
- Check browser console for errors

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Branch Deploys

Deploy different branches to different URLs:
```bash
# Deploy feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-ui
git push origin feature/new-ui
# Netlify auto-creates: https://feature-new-ui--perfectbooking.netlify.app
```

### 2. Instant Rollbacks

Made a mistake? Rollback instantly:
1. Go to **Deploys** in Netlify
2. Find previous working deploy
3. Click **"Publish deploy"**
4. Site reverts in seconds!

### 3. Split Testing

Test different versions:
1. Deploy to different branches
2. Use Netlify's Split Testing feature
3. See which performs better

# Add Netlify Functions (serverless)
mkdir netlify/functions
# Add payment processing, emails, etc.
```
